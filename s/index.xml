Description When designing methods which provide the necessary power to detect regions of the genome which have experience historical selective pressures it is important to consider which patterns of genetic diversity are indicative of particular forms of natural selection. SELSIM is a program which can simulate population genetic data in which a single site has experienced natural selection.</description>

Description The program sequenceLD analyzes sequence data. It obtains an approximation to the likelihood of a summary of the data (as such it can be thought of as a marginal likelihood approach). It does not use all the information in the data, but computationally it can be substantially more efficient than the full-likelihood methods (and hence able to analyze larger data sets).</description>

Description SimPed is a program that quickly generates haplotypes and/or genotype data for a large number of marker loci (&amp;gt;20,000) for pedigrees of virtually any size and complexity. Haplotypes and/or genotypes are generated using user specified genetic map distances and haplotypes and/or allele frequencies.

Description SIMLAPLOT is a tool designed to help visualize the joint effect of genes and continuous environmental covariates on complex human disease simulation models. SIMLAPLOT takes as input the set of genetic model parameters used to generate the data, including risk ratios for genotypes (G), a normally distributed environmental covariate (E) and their interaction (GxE), or the risk ratio for a continuous covariate that is itself influenced by a quantitative trait locus (QTL) and thus follows a mixture normal distribution.</description>

Description The construction of accurate linkage maps is not so much depending on the quality of the mapping software, but mostly on the marker data quality. Missing values and scoring errors can severely influence the calculated marker order. The software tool SMOOTH recognises and removes the most unrealistic data points.

Version 1.0 (2003)
Description a dynamic general database management system to manage high-throughput SNP genotyping data. It provides several functions, including data importing with comparison, Mendelian inheritance check within pedigrees, data compiling and exporting. Furthermore, SNPP may generate files for repeat genotyping and transform them into files that can be executed by a liquid handling system.</description>

Version 1.1.5 (May 2008)
Description SNPTEST is a program for the analysis of single SNP association in genome-wide studies. The tests implemented can cater for binary (case-control) and quantitative phenotypes, can condition upon an arbitrary set of covariates and properly account for the uncertainty in genotypes. The program is designed to work seamlessly with the output of both the genotype calling program CHIAMO, the genotype imputation program IMPUTE and the program GTOOL.</description>

Secondary phenotypes are quantitative or qualitative traits other than the case-control status. Because the case-control sample is not a random sample of the general population, standard statistical analysis of secondary phenotype data can yield very misleading results.</description>

Description ssahaSNP is a polymorphism detection tool. It detects homozygous SNPs and indels by aligning shotgun reads to the finished genome sequence. Highly repetitive elements are filtered out by ignoring those kmer words with high occurrence numbers. For those less repetitive or non-repetitive reads, we place them uniquely on the reference genome sequence and find the best alignment according to the pair-wise alignment score if there are multiple seeded regions.</description>

Version December 2005
Description SWEEP allows large-scale analysis of haplotype structure in genomes for the primary purpose of detecting evidence of natural selection. Primarily, it uses the Long Range Haplotype test to look for alleles of high frequency with long-range linkage disequilibrium, which suggest the haplotype rapidly rose to high frequency before recombination could break down associations with nearby markers. SWEEP takes phased genotype data as input, detects all haplotype blocks in that data, and then determines the frequency and long-range LD for each allele in each block.</description>

Description Syzygy is a targeted sequencing post processing analysis tool that allows: 1. SNP and indel detection; 2. Allele frequency estimation; 3. Single-marker association test; 4. Group-wise marker test association; 5. Experimental QC summary (%dbSNP, Ts/Tv, Ns/S); 6. Power to detect variant.
