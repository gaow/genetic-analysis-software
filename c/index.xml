Full Name Combined Annotation scoRing toOL
Description CAROL is a combined functional annotation score of non-synonymous coding variants. A major challenge in interpreting whole-exome data is predicting which of the discovered variants are deleterious or neutral. To address this question in silico, we have developed a score called Combined Annotation scoRing toOL (CAROL),which combines information from two bioinformatics tools: PolyPhen-2 and SIFT, in order to improve the prediction of the effect of non-synonymous coding variants.</description>

Version 1.0 (January 2006)
Description It is a genetic/radiation hybrid mapping software. CARTHAGENE looks for multiple populations maximum likelihood consensus maps using a fast EM algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation and powerful ordering algorithms inspired from TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem) technology. It can handle large data sets made up of different populations (either F2 backcross, recombinant inbred lines, F2 intercross, phase known outbreds, haploid/diploid radiation hybrids).</description>

Version 0.2.1 (Oct 2007)
Description CHIAMO is a program for calling genotypes from the Affymetrix 500K Mapping chip. The program allows for multiple cohorts which have potentially different intensity characteristics that can lead to elevated false-positive rates in genome-wide studies. The underlying model has a hierarchical structure that allows for correlation between the parameters of each cohort. The output files produced by CHIAMO feed directly into both the programs SNPTEST and IMPUTE.</description>

Description CovIBD refines linkage analysis of affected sibpairs by considering attributes or environmental exposures thought to affect disease liability. This refinement utilizes a mixture model in which a disease mutation segregates in only a fraction of the sibships, with the rest of the sibships unlinked. Covariate information is used to predict membership within the two groups corresponding to the linked and unlinked sibships.</description>

Version version 3 (October 1999)
Description pedigree drawing with fully integrated risk analysis and support for industry standard databases (MS Access and Corel Paradox). designed for genetic counselors and others who work with patients. if you use genetic marker data you need Cyrillic 2. (version 2) this version of Cyrillic draws pedigrees, works with genetic marker data, lets you do haplotyping and allows exports to a range of linkage analysis packages.</description>
